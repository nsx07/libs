   ## Overview

   This open-source Java project provides two essential components for managing data in your applications: a JSON-based database (`Database` class) and a repository  (`Repository` abstract class and `IRepository` interface). These components are designed to simplify data storage, retrieval, and management in your Java applications.

   ## JSON Database (Database Class)

   ### Features

   - Singleton design for managing a single database instance.
   - Dynamic configuration of the source file path.
   - Support for storing and retrieving entities of different types.
   - Exception handling for entities with null IDs.
   - Automatic table creation for entity types.

   ### Getting Started

   #### Prerequisites

   - Java 8 or higher
   - Gson library (included in the project)

   ## Initialization

   To get started with the JSON Database, initialize it and configure the source file path.

   ```java
   // Configure the source file path
   Database.configureSourceFile("data.json");

   // Get the Database instance
   // Using Database directly its low-level and not very recommended
   // Only use if you know well how its works, most of the cases, use Repository
   Database<MyEntity> db = Database.getInstance();
   ```

   ### Entity Configuration
   Configure the entity type before using the database.


   ```java
   db.configureType(MyEntity.class);
   ```
   ### Storing Entities
   You can store entities individually or in a list.

   ```java
   MyEntity entity = new MyEntity();
   entity.setId(UUID.randomUUID());

   try {
      db.set(entity);
   } catch (NullIdException e) {
      // Handle null ID exception
   }
   ```
   ```java
   List<MyEntity> entities = new ArrayList<>();
   // Add entities to the list

   try {
      db.set(entities);
   } catch (NullIdException e) {
      // Handle null ID exception
   }
   ```
   ### Retrieving Entities
   Retrieve entities from the database using the get() method.

   ```java
   Stream<MyEntity> entityStream = db.get();
   // You can further process the stream to work with the retrieved entities.
   ```
   ### Documentation
   For detailed documentation of the Database class and its methods, please refer to the Javadoc comments in the source code.

   ## Repository  (Repository Abstract Class and IRepository Interface)
   ### Features
   * Abstract base class for implementing a generic repository.
   * Common interface for saving, retrieving, and deleting entities.
   * Flexible design to support various entity types and (@soon primary key types).

   ### Usage
   1. #### Create Entity Classes
      Define your entity classes that implement the EntityBase abstract class. These entities represent the data you want to store and retrieve.

   ```java

   public class MyEntity extends EntityBase {
      // Add entity-specific fields and methods here
   }
   ```

   ### Implement a Concrete Repository
   Create a concrete repository class that extends the Repository abstract class. This class should provide the actual data storage and retrieval logic.

   ```java
   public class MyEntityRepository extends Repository<MyEntity> 
   ```

   ### Usage in Application
   In your application code, you can use the concrete repository to save, retrieve, and delete entities.

   ```java
   MyEntityRepository repository = new MyEntityRepository();

   // Save an entity
   MyEntity entity = new MyEntity();
   UUID entityId = repository.save(entity);

   // Retrieve an entity by ID
   MyEntity retrievedEntity = repository.getById(entityId);

   // Retrieve all entities
   List<MyEntity> allEntities = repository.getAll();

   // Delete an entity by ID
   boolean isDeleted = repository.deleteById(entityId);
   ```
